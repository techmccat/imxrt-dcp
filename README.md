# imxrt-dcp

## A library for all (well, most of) your DCP needs.

*This is very experimental and still lacks basic features. 
Do not blame me for blown efuses and stuff.*

## Features

- It might work. (read checklist.md to see the progress so far)

### Story time!

I started writing this because I was angry at being unable to use some of my teensy 4's features and no one had made libraries for it yet (or maybe someone did and I'm just bad at googling.)  
So anyway, I set off on my epic journey of reading sketches on github and NXP docs off of random websites and ended up with a 600 line file that sorta worked.

Months later I thought i cound refactor this into a proper library and damn, making APIs is hard.
